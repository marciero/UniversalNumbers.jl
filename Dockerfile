# Build-from-source image for UniversalNumbers.jl
#
# Compiles the C++ bridge (libuniversal) against the vendored Stillwater
# Universal headers, resolves and precompiles the Julia environment, and drops
# you into a project REPL with all number types ready. Useful for building from
# source (no host C++ toolchain needed on the host, since it lives in the image),
# reproducing CI, and for reviewers who want a one-command working environment.
#
#   docker build -t universalnumbers .
#   docker run --rm -it universalnumbers                                  # Julia REPL with the package
#   docker run --rm -it universalnumbers julia --project=. test/runtests.jl   # run the test suite
#
# Julia 1.10 is the minimum supported version (see Project.toml [compat]).
#
# For a lighter image that installs the PREBUILT package from the General
# registry (no C++ toolchain) and preloads the example packages, see
# Dockerfile.user. Use this Dockerfile to build and test from source; use
# Dockerfile.user to run examples and experiment.
